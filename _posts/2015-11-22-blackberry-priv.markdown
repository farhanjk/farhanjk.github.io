I remember the time when I first tried my BlackBerry Curve and it was amazing. During my journey from Nokia 3310 to Nokia E71, I never imagined a phone to be so much more than what I was getting from my Symbian devices. QWERTY keyboard, that was a wow factor, predictive text and push emails with BES, I thought that is the future in my hand. The fantasy continued after my introduction to Nexus One and hence my first Android; It is limited, it is laggy and where is the damn keyboard? Nah, I will stick with my BlackBerry. The days passed and turned to months with Apple doing its thing and Google playing with Android. No I did not care as its not like they could do anything to take me off the BlackBerry, the innovators of the decade. In the chill of January in 2011, I accidently dropped my BlackBerry and 
everything changed!

**Palette for Android dessert**

I went shopping for a new phone. Nexus S looked much affordable then the replacement BlackBerry I was eyeing. Oh well, life is a compromise. My first few months with Gingerbread were a mixed feeling. The 'Apps' era was sucking me in and I could not resist using Skype on my phone. It was so much more convenient and accessible. This was the turning point where I, like many others, started to notice a stagnancy and lack of innovation at BlackBerry's end. A half-baked Playbook, fiasco of QNX, and a high price point, all when Apple and Google were coming up with something new every 6 months. I have been an avid Android user (Nexus user to be precise) since then. There isn't a Nexus which I have not preordered and wasted hours on UPS website waiting for a new line on the tracking screen. But this changed with Nexus 6. My first disappointment was the bulky size of the device. It was too big for me to carry around. However, I had no choice but to wait for the next Nexus (no Samsung Galaxy series does not have quick OTA updates which I am fond of!). Just when rumors were starting of the two new Nexus phones, there was a surprising announcement from BlackBerry. A BlackBerry powered by Android! Still convinced that BBs have a better build quality than the Nexus series and missing a physical keyboard, I decided that my next phone would not be 5P or 6S, it will be Priv. Here is the story of what happened next. Grab popcorns!

**Wait for it**

I pre-ordered Priv on the first day and in the first hour it was up for pre-ordering. There can be no legitimate excuse from BlackBerry for shipping after a week of its availability at retail stores. But I did get a hard case and premium car charger for ordering directly from BlackBerry to their credit. Out of the box, the phone looks like any other BlackBerry, charming and elegant. There is no mention of it being Android phone either at the front or back. Noticeable features about design are the slide out physical keyboard, 18 megapixel slightly elevated camera with double flash, speakers at the bottom and top of the device and a very professional exterior which BlackBerry is known for. The display is curved at the edge and gives a very elegant look. There is BlackBerry logo at the back and at the top of the display right next to the front camera. All in all, the same hardware that I was in love with before the fall of BlackBerry. 

**Oh that lag!**

On my Nexus devices, specially the early ones, there was a lot of lag; I was presented with a black screen (of death) wondering what the heck did they do with my 500 bucks. With Priv, I am happy to say, I get to replace the worth to 1000 bucks. Just switch to the guest profile and for two minutes, the phone will be in a very disoriented state. The sound buttons have been inconsistent, power button has failed on me couple of times, and screen has refused to swipe up at times. I know it sounds horribly exaggerated but in spite of being very happy when the phone is performing, the high price line makes me notice these bugs more. Lollipop is now much stable with time and Android M is out there. But the engineers at BlackBerry have mostly missed the mark with the software hardware interaction. Being a
developer I know the feeling when someone ignores the majority of your hard responsive work and focuses instead on that one button on that one screen which appears when going deeper than ten screens in the app and has two clicks per year out of a million users. However, I am not taking away the credit, I am just not happy paying this high for a device with more than five easily repeatable bugs.

**A step back?**

As an avid user of Nexus devices, skipping on the latest ones for Priv, I will say it is not a step back. With all its flaws, Priv, under the hood has a lot to its favor. An amazing camera, a vibrant display, and very good signal quality make Priv an ideal phone for a regular smartphone user. For me, the feel of carrying a BlackBerry and the looks that I get when I slide out the keyboard are worth. The device is surprisingly light to carry and do not add a hump like Nexus 6. For the first time in years I have considered a phone for serious typing. The hardware keyboard tempts me to keep writing something, be it just tweets every five minutes. And much of what you are reading here is also typed on Priv itself. All in all, I will say that both BlackBerry and I have made a wise choice.

**On the edge**

'Hey look, my display has an odd looking edge sticking out on the side which has absolutely no use but I will still pay 100s more because it is a edge and I like living on the edge'! No, Priv does not have a useless display edge. It has an edge that is cleverly designed for stuff like indicating the charge level when the phone is plugged in. Swipe on the edge and pops out your daily agenda without going out of the app you are currently using. Pretty smart, eh?

**My table is less messy**

A standout feature of BlackBerry 10 OS has been BlackBerry hub. It consolidates all your emails, chats, tweets, posts, event notifications, reminders and more into one list. Just click on the hub and you can glance at most of the stuff that matters. With Priv, BlackBerry has ported the hub to Android. It has pretty much the same features as its BlackBerry 10 counterpart with some (initial) limitations. As an example, Hangout notifications do not appear in the hub. But I am sure these hurdles won't be much of a bother for BlackBerry as the concept is very interesting, unique and useful and will catch up on the Android users.

**Slide it out**

It will be unfair not to highlight the slide out hardware QWERTY keyboard, as it is one of the selling points for this device; a smart move by BlackBerry to capitalize on one of its biggest assets. It goes without saying that I am impressed out of my wits. A super functional keyboard full of features that make it at par with my Mac's keyboard (just to exaggerate a little!). A combination of hardware and on screen supplementary keyboard adds color to it. When clicking on the symbol key, a software keyboard pops up with all the weird symbols accessible without much pressing around. I feel like a developer when I assign shortcuts for different tasks. A long press on 't' and I can type my tweets, another long press on 's' and Skype pops up. All of this is customizable and even key combinations can be used to assign shortcuts for different tasks. Now how cool is that, no?

**'They' can't find me now &lt;evil laugh&gt;**

They are always after me. They want my life, my data, my sms, my Facebook posts, that pic I once sent to my girlfriend &lt;wink&gt;, and that email I wrote to complain about too much oil in KFC's kitchen. But seriously, all of us, to a variable extent, need privacy and a feeling of security with our content. Android has always been criticized as having a permissions model which allowed many apps to pass through with a lot of sensitive access over my data without user noticing. Priv claims to change all that. With BlackBerry we have all come to associate a stricter security and privacy with our devices. Priv attempts to add a software and hardware layer to securing your Android phone. 'DTEK' by BlackBerry is a service that constantly monitors apps for any suspicious activity. The software has a very simple interface, a scale, which indicates the level of security and privacy of the device with red, yellow, and green colors in the increasing order of security. The device encrypts all data by default and provides protection against rooting the phone. 

**Houston, we have a...**

With so much said, following are the highlights. 

* Hardware Keyboard is definitely a nice edition.
* There are moments when the phone becomes unresponsive.
* It gave me a reason to try out my mobile device for some serious writing.
* It is exciting enough to keep me up at night.
* Popup widgets are new to Android, a useful feature in my opinion. I get an instant peek in my apps without publicizing everything on home screen.
* Is DTEK really worth all that which it is being promoted for? There is obvious information on the interface but I guess it's all about bringing it together on one screen.
* Assigning shortcuts on keyboard is the most developer-ish thing I have done on a mobile device. Thank you Priv.
* Free hard case and premium charger are a bonus for buying off BlackBerry. The hard case increases the width of the phone and adds some weight to the device.

We all have a different perspective of looking at things. This review is no exception. It is written against a first impression that is already biased in favor of BlackBerry. Plus I wrote one section while playing with my daughter with her blocks. So please don't hate me after reading this and equally, don't fall in love with me. I hope it has been a useful read highlighting the device and at the same time, brought a smile on your face. If that is the case, I am done! Chao!
